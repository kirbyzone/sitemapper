# Cre8iv Sitemapper: auto-generated sitemaps for Kirby 3

The Cre8iv Sitemapper is a plugin we created at [Cre8iv Click](https://cre8iv.click), to auto-generate syntactically-correct xml sitemaps for our clients' Kirby websites. Sitemaps are used by search engines to find and catalogue the content of your site - and hopefully help your site rankings!

Here is what you need to know about Sitemapper:

* It makes the sitemap automatically available at _https://yoursite.com/sitemap.xml_. It will also try to guess when a visitor/bot enters a wrong url - such as _http://yoursite.com/en/sitemap.xml_ - and will automatically redirect them to the correct address.
* It uses a nice, customisable stylesheet to display the site in a human-readable format, if accessed on a browser. You can also customise/localise all strings shown in the in-browser sitemap.
* It allows you to carefully control which pages get added to - and excluded from - the sitemap. You can control it via a blueprint option, via a field on individual pages, or by using a custom filtering function.
* You can also control which images get added to the sitemap, and to which pages. You can control it via a bluprint option, and via a field on the individual image content page.
* It maps pages correctly on multilingual sites, whether the page is multilingual or single-language.
* If you're still not happy, Sitemapper allows you to build your own custom mapping function from scratch - useful for advanced sites that use [custom routes](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/routing) and/or [virtual pages](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/virtual-pages).

## Credits

The Cre8iv Sitemapper is developed by [Cre8iv Click](https://cre8iv.click), but we stand on the shoulder of giants:

* the code was started by extending [this Cookbook recipe](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/content/sitemap) in the excellent Kirby Docs
* the stylesheet is based on work done by [Alan Wu](https://github.com/catcto/sitemap-stylesheet)
* some of the logic was based on previous sitemap work done by [David Somers](https://github.com/omz13/kirby3-xmlsitemap)

Styling of the sitemap is done using the amazing [UIKit](https://getuikit.com) frontend framework.
